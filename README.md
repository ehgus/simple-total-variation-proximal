# Tatal variation Optimization toolkit

This package provides optimization tools for image processing and regularization, including Lp unit ball projections and total variation regularizers.

## Features

- **LpUnitBall**: Projections onto Lp unit balls for p = 0, 1, 2, and âˆž
- **LpTotalVariation**: Total variation regularizers with different norms
- **OptProjection/OptRegularizer**: Base classes for optimization operators

## Running the Example

To test the TV denoising functionality:

```matlab
run('script_tv_denoising_test.m')
```
